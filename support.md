If you need help using Octave, you have many options, from reading the Octave
manual, asking for help on the mailing lists, chatting online with other Octave
users, or paying for commercial support.

## Support expectations

The Octave community is a loosely organized association of volunteers. Your
interactions with the community will be better if you have the [right
expectations][expectations] about the support options available to you.

## Commercial support

Community support can be great, and with the Octave community it often is, but
sometimes you need to know that your question will be answered. We maintain [a
list of people and organizations who offer commercial support
contracts][commercial] for Octave. This list is available as a service to the
community and the support providers. The Octave project does not provide
endorsements or recommendations.

## User community

There is an active user community centered around Octave. [Please
understand][expectations] that the people answering your question on the mailing
list or IRC channel, or helping to fix the bug you reported are doing so as
volunteers.

### Documentation

#### Reference manual

Octave is fully documented by a comprehensive 800-page manual.

The online [HTML][html] and [PDF][pdf] versions of the manual are generated
directly from the Texinfo source files that are distributed along with every
copy of the Octave source code. The complete text of the manual is also
available at the Octave prompt using the `doc` command.

A printed version of the Octave manual may be ordered from [Network Theory,
Ltd.][print]. Any money raised from the sale of this book will support the
development of free software. For each copy sold $1 will be donated to the GNU
Octave Development Fund.

#### Frequently asked questions

If you are new to Octave, you may have some [questions that have been asked (and
answered) a few times before][faq].

#### Wiki

The [Octave Wiki][wiki] is a great place to look for information about things
that are not covered in the manual, or other transient topics (Google Summer of
Code, Octave Conferences, etc.).

### Contacting other users for help

#### Mailing list

If your question isn't answered in the FAQ, the manual, or the Wiki, the
`help@octave.org` mailing list is a good resource.

#### Chat

Too impatient for email? You can find Octave developers and users on the
[#octave channel][webchat] at [irc.freenode.net][freenode]. The atmosphere is
relaxed and chat isn't restricted to matters strictly pertaining to Octave.
